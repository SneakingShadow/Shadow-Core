Bottomless void
Make it find items in inventory, then only make it update on pickup-event, and always keep a stack in the inventory, but not more.
Also if two stacks are split, it will leave each stack by making it check for the hovering item in inventory if you can
Make it so it can place blocks and drop event will drop items in the orb if you don't hold shift
Show extra information in gui. Have to different parts of the gui, the simple and the informal.

Hammer workbench, tier 1-3
Tier 1: makes wood, turns wood to stone, and stone to iron
Tier 2: turns iron to gold, and gold to diamond
Tier 3: turns diamond to obsidian and obsidian to devil
Hammers have 7 tiers: wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond, obsidian, devil
Can be upgraded with sword, shovel, pickaxe, axe
Can only be upgraded as far as the hammer, and has to be upgraded the same way as the hammer along with it.
You can't upgrade a gold hammer with a diamond pickaxe, but you can upgrade it with a stone, wood, iron etc.
Hammer has special overlay when it has special items.
Starts out with nothing, not even wood level.

Multiple gates that open with redstone
Opens with a sliding animation

BlockDemonAltar
Metadata = 0:
    tileEntity center, stores all information. Opens gui on right-click.
Metadata != 0:
    blocks around the center block. Will find tileentity and open gui.

Use for demon altar
Make it a 5x5 multiblock

Make the demon furnace explode on 666th use or atleast something funny on the devil's number
Sort out ejection or extraction posibility with the demon furnace.

Ninja Armor.
Need to discuss the mechanics of the armor.
Will it make the user invisible?
When would it make the user invisible?
When sneaking or when having an assassins knife in use?
It would arguably be fairer that when you sneak that the armor becomes invisible, and that when you have all sets of armor it turns the user invisible for all the time the user sneaks, or for a short duration and silences the user so no'one could detetect the users steps.
Fix BlockBVKS so placing with different rotations work better.

Must test entityLivingBase.rotationYaw * 4 / 360 +0.5

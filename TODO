TODO:

Add ItemShadow with custom renderer with check for transparancy. 
Have that check in ItemShadow, that returns integer.
Add Tool utility for ItemShadow. 

Add ItemSpadeShadow, ItemPickaxeShadow, ItemAxeShadow, etc.   
Make sure looking direction thing works

MultiBlock:

Fix up in rotation and stair structure block

Maybe add a rotateToFaces(MultiBlock.Face... faces). 
And also add rotateAroundFace() or rotateAroundFace(MultiBlock.Face... faces).
Although this could be needlessly complicated.
If done, have rotateToFace(MultiBlock.Face face) be in Face class in MultiBlock
